        "> I designed a dataset with 12 students. Instead of random guessing, I established a \"ground truth\" rule to assign labels: a student passes only if **(Study Hours × 8) + Attendance > 120**. This created a linearly separable problem where study hours were weighted heavily, but attendance still mattered. For example, a student with 10 hours but very low attendance (40%) would still fail under my rule.\n",

        "**2. Why the learning rate was chosen:**\n",
        "\n",
        "> I selected a learning rate of **0.001**. Because one of my input features is \"Attendance Percentage\" (values ranging from 0 to 100), the input values are quite large. If I used a standard learning rate like 0.1, the weight updates would be too aggressive **(0.1 * 100 = 10)**, causing the weights to oscillate wildly and never settle. A small rate like 0.001 kept the updates stable.\n",

        "**3. How I verified the model is learning:**\n",
        "\n",
        "> I implemented a print statement that runs every 10 epochs to display the \"Total Loss\" (number of errors). At Epoch 1, the loss was non-zero (the model was making mistakes). By the end of training, the loss dropped to 0 and accuracy reached 100%, which verified that the perceptron successfully adjusted the weights to separate the \"Pass\" data points from the \"Fail\" ones."
